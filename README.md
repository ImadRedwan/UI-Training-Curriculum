# UI Training Curriculum

Welcome to the **UI Training Curriculum**! 
This repository serves as the central hub for the 12-week roadmap designed to train new developers in modern UI development primarily using **React** and **TypeScript**.  

This program is structured to take a beginner from zero experience to being able to contribute meaningfully to real projects and understand company standards and practices.

---

## How It Works

- Each week has its own folder (`week-01-...`, `week-02-...`, … `week-xx-...`) containing:
  - `README.md` → Weekly objectives and summary
  - `tasks.md` → Exercises and assignments
  - `project/` → Starter code or sample projects
- **Branches & Pull Requests:**  
  - Create a new branch for each week separately in this format: "`week-01-yourname`"
  - Complete the tasks and exercises
  - Open a **Pull Request (PR)** for review
- **Review & Feedback:**
  - PRs are reviewed daily (or weekly for larger projects)
  - Feedback includes code quality, structure, and learning notes
