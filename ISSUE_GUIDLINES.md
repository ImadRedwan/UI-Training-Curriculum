# 📝 How to Write an Issue

Whenever you create an Issue, you must write everything from scratch.
This is a practice for writing a good issue and also be familiar with markdown format. 
Do NOT copy-paste ready fields. Use Markdown formatting to structure your content.

---

## 1️⃣ Choose Issue Type
- **Daily Report** → report what you did today, what you learned, blockers
- **Bug / Problem** → describe the problem clearly, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual
- **Question / Blocker** → explain what you don’t understand, what you tried, what you need help with

---

## 2️⃣ Title
Write a short, clear, descriptive title.

Example: Fix alignment issue on Login button

---

## 3️⃣ Body
Write your content in sections using Markdown headers. You **must** cover:

### Context & Goal
- What you planned to do
- Why it matters

### Detailed Description
- Step by step what you did / what happened
- Include screenshots, code snippets, or links if needed

### Technical Notes
- Tools, libraries, UI components, layout structure
- Any files or modules involved

### Questions & Blockers
- Where are you stuck?
- What exactly do you need help with?

### Self-Assessment
- What did you learn today?
- What is still unclear?

### Next Steps
- Clear actionable steps for tomorrow / next task

### Time Spent
- How long did you spend on this task?
